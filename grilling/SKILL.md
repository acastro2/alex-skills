## Asking

When you need a decision from Alex, ask through the `question` tool, not prose. One call
carries the whole round. The recommended option goes first, and its description carries the
why. Do not add a "type your own answer" option: the tool adds it. A decision with one
plausible answer is not a question, so decide it and say why. Where this skill defines its
own review or answer format, that format wins. If the host has no question tool, use
`❓ **Q1 - <title>**: ...` and `➡️ <answer and why>` in the same place.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one `question` call, one question per decision, the recommended answer first. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Each question's `header` is the decision's short title. Its body states the facts you found and the options you ruled out. Word it so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Only when the host has no `question` tool, put the round in the chat in this form, in the same place the call would go:

```
❓ **Q1 - <title>**: <question, with the options>

➡️ <your recommended answer and the reason>
```

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
